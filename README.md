HackerNews SSR Implementation

# **HackerNews SSR Implementation** React App with a Express on Google Compute Engine

A minimal example of using a Server Side Rendering (server for API, proxy, & routing) with a [React frontend]
This application uses https://hn.algolia.com/api api to load posts from Hacker News

This project is deployed live at http://34.72.209.226:8080/

## Design Points

A combo of two npm projects, the backend server and the frontend UI. So there are two `package.json` configs and thereforce [two places to run `npm` commands](#user-content-local-development):

  1. [**Node server**](server/): [`./package.json`](package.json)
      * [deployed automatically](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment) via heroku/nodejs buildpack
  2. [**React UI**](react-ui/): [`react-ui/package.json`](react-ui/package.json)
      * generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
      * deployed via `build` script in the Node server's [`./package.json`](package.json)
      * module cache configured by `cacheDirectories`

Includes a minimal [Node Cluster](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/cluster.html) [implementation](server/index.js) to parallelize the single-threaded Node process across the available CPU cores.

## Demo

[Demo deployment](http://34.72.209.226:8080/): example API call from the React UI is [fetched with a relative URL](react-ui/src/App.js#L16) that is served by an Express handler in the Node server.


## Deploy to Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShubhamAnand/hackerNews.git
cd hackerNews/
npm install
npm run start
```

This deployment will automatically:

  * detect [Node buildpack](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs)
  * build the app with
    * `npm install` for the Node server
    * `npm run start` for Building using Webpack & Deploying using babel node
    * customize by adding API, proxy, or route handlers/redirectors

#### Features In Current Version:

1.Hide functionality is correctly implemented.

2. Upvote ui is implemented. 

3. Pagination is working.

4. Previous/back functionality is well implemented.

5. Ensure Page 2 functionality does not break while refreshing it.

6. App state is maintained using Redux.

7. Component is divided properly and try using Atomic Design principle.

8. Incorporated ESlint check

9. App is deployed on Cloud platform (Google App Engine)

10. Incorporated build pipeline.

11. Once u hide news and refresh it, the hidden news should not appear again.

12.The UI should shrink when you minimize the window

13. Single Page Application with extensive caching, so application loads very fast post the first load.

#### Future Implementation in more time:

Some of the things that re left out due to time constraints but I will add them in future are:

1. Writing Snapshot & Unit Tests for all components using Jest & Enzyme with >80% functional coverage.
2. Following best coding practices.
3. Implement upvote functionality (add more upvotes donâ€™t restrict on just one; The timeline chart should update real time as and when the upvote is clicked)
